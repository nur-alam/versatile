Versatile allows you to disable any plugin selectively for your IP or specific users. Safely debug and test on your live site without affecting your real visitors.

== Description ==

Versatile makes it easy to control active plugins by IP address or user. Debug plugin conflicts and experiment live, without disturbing your users' experience. Future updates will bring even more small but powerful WordPress tools into one plugin — such as site reset, backups, SMTP setup, AI integration for content generation, and more.

**Key Features:**

* Disable specific plugins only for your IP address
* Choose to disable plugins for specific admin users
* Live simulation feature: test which plugins would be disabled for your IP
* Full logging system with rotation and manual clearing
* Export/import plugin settings as JSON
* REST API support for external integrations
* Clean, modern, and modular code architecture
* Ready for future add-ons: reset site, backups, SMTP, AI content tools, etc.

**Future features preview:**

* Site reset & clean-up utilities
* One-click full site backup & restore
* SMTP configuration & email logging
* AI-powered title, excerpt, and image generation
* One dashboard for all WordPress micro-tools
